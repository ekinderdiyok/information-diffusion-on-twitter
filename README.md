# Information diffusion on X (formerly Twitter): a model comparison approach
This repository hosts the code and manuscript of my master's thesis project with the abovementioned title.

## Abstract
The application of network science principles provides a comprehensive understanding of a broad range of complex systems. X (formerly known as Twitter), a popular online microblogging platform, is one such information system where users are connected with follower relationships and information is conveyed between users. In this study, I investigate the diffusion of information by comparing basic mathematical models and compartmental models borrowed from epidemiology to account for the virality claims on Twitter, which is a colloquially shared concept between diseases and social media. Results showed that compartmental models are not especially good at explaining the reach of a tweet, but are open for improvement. The temporal course of a tweet was well captured with a logarithmic function. Models used in this study are compared, and relation to neuroscience research are discussed.
