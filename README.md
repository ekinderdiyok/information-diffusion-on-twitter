# Information diffusion on ùïè (formerly Twitter): a model comparison approach
1. Builds social network graphs using NetworkX, Python.
2. Investigates information diffusion using epidemiological models.
3. Models the life-cycle of a tweet.
4. Employs OpenAI API for identifying tweets' topics.
5. Writes a 50-page scientific report with 50+ citations using LaTeX.

## Executive Summary
**Objective:** Build a model to predict a tweet's potential outreach and its temporal life-cycle, compare different topics, more and less influential users, uncover other factors contributing to a tweet's virality.

**Methodology:** Start with a simple model, gradually add new parameters and more realistic assumption, compare each time with the more primitive model. Use OpenAI API to identify tweet topics.

**Recommendations:** Contrary to common perception, most popular tweets are not viral, but broadcast events. The use of epidemiological models are discouraged. The first two hours of a tweet are vital. LLMs are a good alternative NLP method.

## Abstract (Scientific)
The application of network science principles provides a comprehensive understanding of a broad range of complex systems. X (formerly known as Twitter), a popular online microblogging platform, is one such information system where users are connected with follower relationships and information is conveyed between users. In this study, I investigate the diffusion of information by comparing basic mathematical models and compartmental models borrowed from epidemiology to account for the virality claims on Twitter, which is a colloquially shared concept between diseases and social media. Results showed that compartmental models are not especially good at explaining the reach of a tweet, but are open for improvement. The temporal course of a tweet was well captured with a logarithmic function. Models used in this study are compared, and relation to neuroscience research are discussed.
