	abstract = {Models for the processes by which ideas and influence propagate through a social network have been studied in a number of domains, including the diffusion of medical and technological innovations, the sudden and widespread adoption of various strategies in game-theoretic settings, and the effects of "word of mouth" in the promotion of new products. Recently, motivated by the design of viral marketing strategies, Domingos and Richardson posed a fundamental algorithmic problem for such social network processes: if we can try to convince a subset of individuals to adopt a new product or innovation, and the goal is to trigger a large cascade of further adoptions, which set of individuals should we target?We consider this problem in several of the most widely studied models in social network analysis. The optimization problem of selecting the most influential nodes is NP-hard here, and we provide the first provable approximation guarantees for efficient algorithms. Using an analysis framework based on submodular functions, we show that a natural greedy strategy obtains a solution that is provably within 63\% of optimal for several classes of models; our framework suggests a general approach for reasoning about the performance guarantees of algorithms for these types of influence problems in social networks.We also provide computational experiments on large collaboration networks, showing that in addition to their provable guarantees, our approximation algorithms significantly out-perform node-selection heuristics based on the well-studied notions of degree centrality and distance centrality from the field of social networks.},

	abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks [28]. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85\%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

For each of these properties, we compare and contrast with available data from other social networks. These analyses provide a set of authoritative statistics that the community can reference. In addition, we use these data to investigate an often-posed question: Is Twitter a social network or an information network? The "follow" relationship in Twitter is primarily about information consumption, yet many follows are built on social ties. Not surprisingly, we find that the Twitter follow graph exhibits structural characteristics of both an information network and a social network. Going beyond descriptive characterizations, we hypothesize that from an individual user's perspective, Twitter starts off more like an information network, but evolves to behave more like a social network. We provide preliminary evidence that may serve as a formal model of how a hybrid network like Twitter evolves.},

	abstract = {Viral products and ideas are intuitively understood to grow through a person-to-person diffusion process analogous to the spread of an infectious disease; however, until recently it has been prohibitively difficult to directly observe purportedly viral events, and thus to rigorously quantify or characterize their structural properties. Here we propose a formal measure of what we label “structural virality” that interpolates between two conceptual extremes: content that gains its popularity through a single, large broadcast and that which grows through multiple generations with any one individual directly responsible for only a fraction of the total adoption. We use this notion of structural virality to analyze a unique data set of a billion diffusion events on Twitter, including the propagation of news stories, videos, images, and petitions. We find that across all domains and all sizes of events, online diffusion is characterized by surprising structural diversity; that is, popular events regularly grow via both broadcast and viral mechanisms, as well as essentially all conceivable combinations of the two. Nevertheless, we find that structural virality is typically low, and remains so independent of size, suggesting that popularity is largely driven by the size of the largest broadcast. Finally, we attempt to replicate these findings with a model of contagion characterized by a low infection rate spreading on a scale-free network. We find that although several of our empirical findings are consistent with such a model, it fails to replicate the observed diversity of structural virality, thereby suggesting new directions for future modeling efforts.

We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

	abstract = {Social media has become extremely influential when it comes to policy making in modern societies, especially in the western world, where platforms such as Twitter allow users to follow politicians, thus making citizens more involved in political discussion. In the same vein, politicians use Twitter to express their opinions, debate among others on current topics and promote their political agendas aiming to influence voter behaviour. In this paper, we attempt to analyse tweets of politicians from three European countries and explore the virality of their tweets. Previous studies have shown that tweets conveying negative sentiment are likely to be retweeted more frequently. By utilising state-of-the-art pre-trained language models, we performed sentiment analysis on hundreds of thousands of tweets collected from members of parliament in Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom, including devolved administrations. We achieved this by systematically exploring and analysing the differences between influential and less popular tweets. Our analysis indicates that politicians’ negatively charged tweets spread more widely, especially in more recent times, and highlights interesting differences between political parties as well as between politicians and the general population.},

The study collected 425 unique tweets posted by CDC during a 17-week period and constructed a diffusion tree for each unique tweet. Findings indicated that, with respect to message features, perceived efficacy after reading a tweet positively predicted diffusion size of the tweet, whereas perceived susceptibility to a health condition after reading a tweet positively predicted structural virality of the tweet. Perceived negative emotion positively predicted both size and structural virality. With respect to network features, the level of involvement of brokers in diffusing a tweet increased the tweet's structural virality.

Many other transformations in the life, physical and social sciences follow a similar pattern of nucleation and growth. The Avrami equation has been applied widely to modelling such phenomena, including COVID-19, regardless of whether they have a formal thermodynamic basis. We present here an analytical overview of such applications of the Avrami equation outside its conventional use, emphasizing examples from the life sciences. We discuss the similarities that at least partially justify the extended application of the model to such cases. We point out the limitations of such adoption; some are inherent to the model itself, and some are associated with the extended contexts. We also propose a reasoned justification for why the model performs well in many of these non-thermodynamic applications, even when some of its fundamental assumptions are not satisfied. In particular, we explore connections between the relatively accessible verbal and mathematical language of everyday nucleation- and growth-based phase transformations, represented by the Avrami equation, and the more challenging language of the classic SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model in epidemiology.},

This is intended to capture the observed practice of informal knowledge trading. Agents are located on a network and are directly connected with a small number of other agents. Agents repeatedly meet those with whom direct connections exist and trade if mutually profitable trades exist. In this way knowledge diffuses throughout the economy. We examine the relationship between network architecture and diffusion performance. We consider the space of structures that fall between, at one extreme, a network in which every agent is connected to n nearest neighbours, and at the other extreme a network with each agent being connected to, on average, n randomly chosen agents. We find that the performance of the system exhibits clear ‘small world’ properties, in that the steady-state level of average knowledge is maximal when the structure is a small world (that is, when most connections are local, but roughly 10 percent of them are long distance). The variance of knowledge levels among agents is maximal in the small world region, whereas the coefficient of variation is minimal. We explain these results as reflecting the dynamics of knowledge transmission as affected by the architecture of connections among agents.},

How can transparency and autonomy be promoted instead, thus fostering the positive potential of the web? Effective web governance informed by behavioural research is critically needed to empower individuals online. We identify technologically available yet largely untapped cues that can be harnessed to indicate the epistemic quality of online content, the factors underlying algorithmic decisions and the degree of consensus in online debates.

Recently, social media data, particularly Twitter, has seen some use for public health purposes. Every large technological development in history has had an impact on the behaviour of society. The advent of the internet and social media is no different. Social media creates public streams of communication, and scientists are starting to understand that such data can provide some level of access into the people's opinions and situations. As such, this paper aims to review and synthesize the literature on Twitter applications for public health, highlighting current research and products in practice. A scoping review methodology was employed and four leading health, computer science and cross-disciplinary databases were searched. A total of 755 articles were retreived, 92 of which met the criteria for review. From the reviewed literature, six domains for the application of Twitter to public health were identified: (i) Surveillance; (ii) Event Detection; (iii) Pharmacovigilance; (iv) Forecasting; (v) Disease Tracking; and (vi) Geographic Identification. From our review, we were able to obtain a clear picture of the use of Twitter for public health. We gained insights into interesting observations such as how the popularity of different domains changed with time, the diseases and conditions studied and the different approaches to understanding each disease, which algorithms and techniques were popular with each domain, and more.},

	abstract = {Do some types of information spread faster, broader, or further than others? To understand how information diffusions differ, scholars compare structural properties of the paths taken by content as it spreads through a network, studying so-called cascades. Commonly studied cascade properties include the reach, depth, breadth, and speed of propagation. Drawing conclusions from statistical differences in these properties can be challenging, as many properties are dependent. In this work, we demonstrate the essentiality of controlling for cascade sizes when studying structural differences between collections of cascades. We first revisit two datasets from notable recent studies of online diffusion that reported content-specific differences in cascade topology: an exhaustive corpus of Twitter cascades for verified true- or false-news content by Vosoughi et al. [S. Vosoughi, D. Roy, S. Aral. Science 359, 1146–1151 (2018)] and a comparison of Twitter cascades of videos, pictures, news, and petitions by Goel et al. [S. Goel, A. Anderson, J. Hofman, D. J. Watts. Manage. Sci. 62, 180–196 (2016)]. Using methods that control for joint cascade statistics, we find that for false- and true-news cascades, the reported structural differences can almost entirely be explained by false-news cascades being larger. For videos, images, news, and petitions, structural differences persist when controlling for size. Studying classical models of diffusion, we then give conditions under which differences in structural properties under different models do or do not reduce to differences in size. Our findings are consistent with the mechanisms underlying true- and false-news diffusion being quite similar, differing primarily in the basic infectiousness of their spreading process.},

	abstract = {The social and behavioral sciences have been increasingly using automated text analysis to measure psychological constructs in text. We explore whether GPT, the large-language model underlying the artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT, can be used as a tool for automated psychological text analysis in various languages. Across 15 datasets (n = 31,789 manually annotated tweets and news headlines), we tested whether GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can accurately detect psychological constructs (sentiment, discrete emotions, and offensiveness) across 12 languages (English, Arabic, Indonesian, and Turkish, as well as eight African languages including Swahili, Amharic, Yoruba and Kinyarwanda). We found that GPT performs much better than English-language dictionary-based text analysis (r = 0.66-0.75 for correlations between manual annotations and GPT-4, as opposed to r = 0.20-0.30 for correlations between manual annotations and dictionary methods). Further, GPT performs nearly as well as or better than several fine-tuned machine learning models, though GPT had poorer performance in African languages and in comparison to more recent fine-tuned models. Overall, GPT may be superior to many existing methods of automated text analysis, since it achieves relatively high accuracy across many languages, requires no training data, and is easy to use with simple prompts (e.g., “is this text negative?”) and little coding experience. We provide sample code for analyzing text with the GPT application programming interface. GPT and other large-language models may be the future of psychological text analysis, and may help facilitate more cross-linguistic research with understudied languages.},

The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.},

              In recent years, malicious information had an explosive growth in social media, with serious social and political backlashes.

They offer a unique mechanism of sharing information by allowing users to receive all messages posted by those whom they ‘‘follow’’. As information in today’s SNSs often spreads in the form of hashtags, detecting rapidly spreading hashtags in SNSs has recently attracted much attention. In this paper, we propose realistic epidemic models to describe the probabilistic process of hashtag propagation. Our models take into account the way how users communicate in SNSs; moreover the models consider the inﬂuence of external media and separate it from internal diffusion within networks. Based on the proposed models, we develop efﬁcient inference algorithms that measure the propagation rates of hashtags in social networks. With real-life social network data including hashtags and synthetic data obtained by simulating information diffusion, we show that the proposed algorithms ﬁnd fast-spreading hashtags more accurately than existing algorithms. Moreover, our in-depth case study demonstrates that our algorithms correctly ﬁnd internal diffusion rates of hashtags as well as external media inﬂuences.},

We employed a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore the studies related to information diffusion on Twitter extracted from four digital libraries. In this paper, a two-stage analysis was conducted. First, we implemented a bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and R-bibliometrix software. This approach was applied to select 204 papers after conducting a duplication check and assessing the inclusion–exclusion criteria. At this stage, we mapped the authors’ collaborative networks/collaborators and the evolution of research themes. Second, we analyzed the gap in research themes on the application of CTMC information diffusion on Twitter. Further ﬁltering criteria were applied, and 34 papers were analyzed to identify the research objectives, methods, metrics, and measures used by each researcher. Nonhomogeneous CTMC has never been used in Twitter information diffusion modeling. This ﬁnding motivates us to further study nonhomogeneous CTMC as a modeling approach for Twitter information diffusion.},

	abstract = {Influence diffusion is extensively studied in social networks for product or service promotion and viral-marketing applications. This paper proposes two models for social influence estimation, namely Time Decay Features Cascade Model (TDF-C) and Time Decay Features Cascade Threshold Model (TDF-CT). These models overcome three main existing challenges - first, measure the strength of user's influence as an influencer; second, identify the set of users influenced by an influencer; third, estimate the time frame of the influence. TDF-C is an M-TAP based diffusion model, which learns influence probabilities between users using four types of features, namely temporal, interaction, structural, and profile features, and uses Independent Cascade (IC) model for influence estimation. TDF-CT is an extension of the TDF-C model, which uses temporal and interaction features to calculate the diffusion through the Progressive Feedback Estimation (PFE) model in place of IC model. PFE model is a fusion of two diffusion models, i.e., Linear Threshold (LT) and Independent Cascade. TDF-CT handles the limitations of the contemporary diffusion models, i.e., IC and LT. The efficacy of proposed models is evaluated with respect to existing models Independent Cascade (IC), Time Constant Cascade (TC-C), Time Decay Cascade (TD-C), and Time-Depth Decay Cascade (TDD-C). Experimental evaluation over two benchmark datasets namely Darwin and MelCup17 reveal that proposed models are able to make the predictions very close to the real-time in a given time frame. TDF-CT and TDF-C are most suitable for applications requiring high precision and high recall, respectively. Results of spread shape establish the efficacy of models to spread the influence with good coverage of the social network. Results are obtained with improved accuracy by up to 39\%.},

	abstract = {The problem of spreading information is a topic of considerable recent interest, but the traditional influence maximization problem is inadequate for a typical viral marketer who cannot access the entire network topology. To fix this flawed assumption that the marketer can control any arbitrary k nodes in a network, we have developed a decentralized version of the influential maximization problem by influencing k neighbors rather than arbitrary users in the entire network. We present several practical strategies and evaluate their performance with a real dataset collected from Twitter during the 2010 UK election campaign. Our experimental results show that information can be efficiently propagated in online social networks using neighbors with a high propagation rate rather than those with a high number of neighbors. To examine the importance of using real propagation rates, we additionally performed an experiment under the same conditions except the use of synthetic propagation rates, which is widely used in studying the influence maximization problem and found that their results were significantly different from real-world experiences.},

The ﬁrst approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.},

Agents repeatedly meet those with whom direct connections exist and trade if mutually proÿtable trades exist. In this way knowledge di uses throughout the economy. We examine the relationship between network architecture and di usion performance. We consider the space of structures that fall between, at one extreme, a network in which every agent is connected to n nearest neighbours, and at the other extreme a network with each agent being connected to, on average, n randomly chosen agents. We ÿnd that the performance of the system exhibits clear ‘small world’ properties, in that the steady-state level of average knowledge is maximal when the structure is a small world (that is, when most connections are local, but roughly 10 percent of them are long distance). The variance of knowledge levels among agents is maximal in the small world region, whereas the coe cient of variation is minimal. We explain these results as re ecting the dynamics of knowledge transmission as a ected by the architecture of connections among agents.},

We develop an epidemic model for information spread in Twitter and we validate it using real data for several hashtags chosen so as to cover a variety of characteristics. Contrary to the existing works in literature, which deﬁne the informed Twitter users as those who have produced/reproduced tweets with a speciﬁc hashtag, our model considers as informed a superset of Twitter users who have seen/produced/reproduced tweets with a speciﬁc hashtag. Thus, it does not underestimate the extent of information propagation in the network. The evaluation results indicate a satisfactory performance of the proposed epidemic model for all hashtag types examined; while more importantly, they allow studying the impact of several factors, such as the need of time-varying infection rates depending on the hashtag type.},

An important first step toward understanding the function of such a network is to map its elements and connections, to create a comprehensive structural description of the network architecture. This paper reviews current empirical efforts toward generating a network map of the human brain, the human connectome, and explores how the connectome can provide new insights into the organization of the brain's structural connections and their role in shaping functional dynamics. Network studies of structural connectivity obtained from noninvasive neuroimaging have revealed a number of highly nonrandom network attributes, including high clustering and modularity combined with high efficiency and short path length. The combination of these attributes simultaneously promotes high specialization and high integration within a modular small‐world architecture. Structural and functional networks share some of the same characteristics, although their relationship is complex and nonlinear. Future studies of the human connectome will greatly expand our knowledge of network topology and dynamics in the healthy, developing, aging, and diseased brain.},

Rather, they interact with other such elements through their afferent and efferent connections in an orchestrated manner so as to enable different sensorimotor and cognitive tasks to be performed. The concept of functional connectivity and the allied notion of effective connectivity were introduced to designate the functional strengths of such interactions. Functional neuroimaging methods, especially PET and fMRI, have been used extensively to evaluate the functional connectivity between different brain regions. After providing a brief historical review of these notions of brain connectivity, I argue that the conceptual formulations of functional and effective connectivity are far from clear. Speciﬁcally, the terms functional and effective connectivity are applied to quantities computed on types of functional imaging data (e.g., PET, fMRI, EEG) that vary in spatial, temporal, and other features, using different deﬁnitions (even for data of the same modality) and employing different computational algorithms. Until it is understood what each deﬁnition means in terms of an underlying neural substrate, comparisons of functional and/or effective connectivity across studies may appear inconsistent and should be performed with great caution.},

	abstract = {Since the discovery of small-world and scale-free networks the study of complex systems from a network perspective has taken an enormous flight. In recent years many important properties of complex networks have been delineated. In particular, significant progress has been made in understanding the relationship between the structural properties of networks and the nature of dynamics taking place on these networks. For instance, the 'synchronizability' of complex networks of coupled oscillators can be determined by graph spectral analysis. These developments in the theory of complex networks have inspired new applications in the field of neuroscience. Graph analysis has been used in the study of models of neural networks, anatomical connectivity, and functional connectivity based upon fMRI, EEG and MEG. These studies suggest that the human brain can be modelled as a complex network, and may have a small-world structure both at the level of anatomical as well as functional connectivity. This small-world structure is hypothesized to reflect an optimal situation associated with rapid synchronization and information transfer, minimal wiring costs, as well as a balance between local processing and global integration. The topological structure of functional networks is probably restrained by genetic and anatomical factors, but can be modified during tasks. There is also increasing evidence that various types of brain disease such as Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, brain tumours and epilepsy may be associated with deviations of the functional network topology from the optimal small-world pattern.},

	abstract = {Functional imaging studies have shown that certain brain regions, including posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), consistently show greater activity during resting states than during cognitive tasks. This finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral prefrontal regions and PCC, suggesting a mechanism for attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive processing. This study constitutes, to our knowledge, the first resting-state connectivity analysis of the default mode and provides the most compelling evidence to date for the existence of a cohesive default mode network. Our findings also provide insight into how this network is modulated by task demands and what functions it might subserve.},

For example, by detecting where connection patterns change, one can deﬁne anatomical borders between cortical regions or subcortical nuclei in the living human brain for the ﬁrst time. Because diffusion tractography is a relatively new technique, however, it is important to assess its validity critically. We discuss the degree to which diffusion tractography meets the requirements of a technique to assess structural connectivity and how its results compare to those from the gold-standard tract tracing methods in nonhuman animals. We conclude that although tractography offers novel opportunities it also raises signiﬁcant challenges to be addressed by further validation studies to deﬁne precisely the limitations and scope of this exciting new technique.},

            Cognition and comportment are subserved by interconnected neural networks that allow high‐level computational architectures including parallel distributed processing. Cognitive problems are not resolved by a sequential and hierarchical progression toward predetermined goals but instead by a simultaneous and interactive consideration of multiple possibilities and constraints until a satisfactory fit is achieved. The resultant texture of mental activity is characterized by almost infinite richness and flexibility. According to this model, complex behavior is mapped at the level of multifocal neural systems rather than specific anatomical sites, giving rise to brain‐behavior relationships that are both localized and distributed. Each network contains anatomically addressed channels for transferring information content and chemically addressed pathways for modulating behavioral tone. This approach provides a blueprint for reexploring the neurological foundations of attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function.},

	abstract = {The brain is a large‐scale network, operating at multiple levels of information processing ranging from neurons, to local circuits, to systems of brain areas. Recent advances in the mathematics of graph theory have provided tools with which to study networks. These tools can be employed to understand how the brain's behavioral repertoire is mediated by the interactions of objects of information processing. Within the graph‐theoretic framework, networks are defined by independent objects (nodes) and the relationships shared between them (edges). Importantly, the accurate incorporation of graph theory into the study of brain networks mandates careful consideration of the assumptions, constraints, and principles of both the mathematics and the underlying neurobiology. This review focuses on understanding these principles and how they guide what constitutes a brain network and its elements, specifically focusing on resting‐state correlations in humans. We argue that approaches that fail to take the principles of graph theory into consideration and do not reflect the underlying neurobiological properties of the brain will likely mischaracterize brain network structure and function.},

	abstract = {In the cerebral cortex, the activity levels of neuronal populations are continuously fluctuating. When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (
              i
              ) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (
              ii
              ) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (
              iii
              ) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

Here, we tested this hypothesis with multimodality neuroimaging. With diﬀusion MRI (DMRI), we showed that diﬀerences in structural integrity of particular white matter (WM) tracts, including cingulum bundle, extreme capsule and arcuate fasciculus were associated with an individual’s social network size (SNS). A voxel-based morphology analysis demonstrated correlations between gray matter (GM) volume and SNS in limbic and temporal lobe regions. These structural changes co-occured with functional network diﬀerences. As a function of SNS, dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed altered resting-state functional connectivity with the default mode network (DMN). Finally, we integrated these three complementary methods, interrogating the relationship between social GM clusters and speciﬁc WM and resting-state networks (RSNs). Probabilistic tractography seeded in these GM nodes utilized the SNS-related WM pathways. Further, the spatial and functional overlap between the social GM clusters and the DMN was signiﬁcantly closer than other control RSNs. These integrative analyses provide convergent evidence of the role of speciﬁc circuits in SNS, likely supporting the adaptive behavior necessary for success in extensive social environments.},

Accordingly, previous studies have observed that larger orbitofrontal and amygdala structures predict the size of an individual's social network. However, it remains uncertain how an individual's social connectedness reported by other people is associated with the social brain volume. In this study, we found that a greater in-degree network size, a measure of social ties identified by a subject's social connections rather than by the subject, significantly correlated with a larger regional volume of the orbitofrontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and lingual gyrus. By contrast, out-degree size, which is based on an individual's self-perceived connectedness, showed no associations. Meta-analytic reverse inference further revealed that regional volume pattern of in-degree size was specifically involved in social inference ability. These findings were possible because our dataset contained the social networks of an entire village, i.e. a global network. The results suggest that the in-degree aspect of social network size not only confirms the previously reported brain correlates of the social network but also shows an association in brain regions involved in the ability to infer other people's minds. This study provides insight into understanding how the social brain is uniquely associated with sociocentric measures derived from a global network.},

	abstract = {Significance
            In what ways are we similar to our friends? Here, we characterized the social network of residents of a remote village, a subset of whom contributed personality and neuroimaging data. We demonstrate that similarity in individuals’ resting-state functional connectomes predicts individuals’ proximity in their real-world social network, even when controlling for demographic characteristics and self-reported personality traits. Our results suggest that patterns of functional brain activity during rest encode latent similarities (e.g., in terms of how people think and behave) that are associated with friendship. Taken together, integrating neuroimaging and social network analysis can offer novel insights into how the brain shapes or is shaped by the social networks that it inhabits.
          , 
            People often have the intuition that they are similar to their friends, yet evidence for homophily (being friends with similar others) based on self-reported personality is inconsistent. Functional connectomes—patterns of spontaneous synchronization across the brain—are stable within individuals and predict how people tend to think and behave. Thus, they may capture interindividual variability in latent traits that are particularly similar among friends but that might elude self-report. Here, we examined interpersonal similarity in functional connectivity at rest—that is, in the absence of external stimuli—and tested if functional connectome similarity is associated with proximity in a real-world social network. The social network of a remote village was reconstructed; a subset of residents underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Similarity in functional connectomes was positively related to social network proximity, particularly in the default mode network. Controlling for similarities in demographic and personality data (the Big Five personality traits) yielded similar results. Thus, functional connectomes may capture latent interpersonal similarities between friends that are not fully captured by commonly used demographic or personality measures. The localization of these results suggests how friends may be particularly similar to one another. Additionally, geographic proximity moderated the relationship between neural similarity and social network proximity, suggesting that such associations are particularly strong among people who live particularly close to one another. These findings suggest that social connectivity is reflected in signatures of brain functional connectivity, consistent with the common intuition that friends share similarities that go beyond, for example, demographic similarities.},

Such regions have been previously implicated in social perception and associative memory, respectively. We further show that variability in the size of such online friendship networks was significantly correlated with the size of more intimate real-world social groups. However, the brain regions we identified were specifically associated with online social network size, whereas the grey matter density of the amygdala was correlated both with online and real-world social network sizes.

	abstract = {Although graph theory has been around since the 18th century, the ﬁeld of network science is more recent and continues to gain popularity, particularly in the ﬁeld of neuroimaging. The ﬁeld was propelled forward when Watts and Strogatz introduced their small-world network model, which described a network that provided regional specialization with efﬁcient global information transfer. This model is appealing to the study of brain connectivity, as the brain can be viewed as a system with various interacting regions that produce complex behaviors. In practice, graph metrics such as clustering coefﬁcient, path length, and efﬁciency measures are often used to characterize system properties. Centrality metrics such as degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality determine critical areas within the network. Community structure is also essential for understanding network organization and topology. Network science has led to a paradigm shift in the neuroscientiﬁc community, but it should be viewed as more than a simple ‘‘tool du jour.’’ To fully appreciate the utility of network science, a greater understanding of how network models apply to the brain is needed. An integrated appraisal of multiple network analyses should be performed to better understand network structure rather than focusing on univariate comparisons to ﬁnd signiﬁcant group differences; indeed, such comparisons, popular with traditional functional magnetic resonance imaging analyses, are arguably no longer relevant with graph-theory based approaches. These methods necessitate a philosophical shift toward complexity science. In this context, when correctly applied and interpreted, network scientiﬁc methods have a chance to revolutionize the understanding of brain function.},

	abstract = {The evolution of unusually large brains in some groups of animals, notably primates, has long been a puzzle. Although early explanations tended to emphasize the brain's role in sensory or technical competence (foraging skills, innovations, and way-finding), the balance of evidence now clearly favors the suggestion that it was the computational demands of living in large, complex societies that selected for large brains. However, recent analyses suggest that it may have been the particular demands of the more intense forms of pairbonding that was the critical factor that triggered this evolutionary development. This may explain why primate sociality seems to be so different from that found in most other birds and mammals: Primate sociality is based on bonded relationships of a kind that are found only in pairbonds in other taxa.},

          , 
            It has been suggested that variation in brain structure correlates with the sizes of individuals’ social networks. Whether variation in social network size causes variation in brain structure, however, is unknown. To address this question, we neuroimaged 23 monkeys that had been living in social groups set to different sizes. Subject comparison revealed that living in larger groups caused increases in gray matter in mid-superior temporal sulcus and rostral prefrontal cortex and increased coupling of activity in frontal and temporal cortex. Social network size, therefore, contributes to changes both in brain structure and function. The changes have potential implications for an animal’s success in a social context; gray matter differences in similar areas were also correlated with each animal’s dominance within its social network.},

	abstract = {(1) One of the most striking features in the study of epidemics is the difficulty of finding a causal factor which appears to be adequate to account for the magnitude of the frequent epidemics of disease which visit almost every population. It was with a view to obtaining more insight regarding the effects of the various factors which govern the spread of contagious epidemics that the present investigation was undertaken. Reference may here be made to the work of Ross and Hudson (1915-17) in which the same problem is attacked. The problem is here carried to a further stage, and it is considered from a point of view which is in one sense more general. The problem may be summarised as follows: One (or more) infected person is introduced into a community of individuals, more or less susceptible to the disease in question. The disease spreads from the affected to the unaffected by contact infection. Each infected person runs through the course of his sickness, and finally is removed from the number of those who are sick, by recovery or by death. The chances of recovery or death vary from day to day during the course of his illness. The chances that the affected may convey infection to the unaffected are likewise dependent upon the stage of the sickness. As the epidemic spreads, the number of unaffected members of the community becomes reduced. Since the course of an epidemic is short compared with the life of an individual, the population may be considered as remaining constant, except in as far as it is modified by deaths due to the epidemic disease itself. In the course of time the epidemic may come to an end. One of the most important probems in epidemiology is to ascertain whether this termination occurs only when no susceptible individuals are left, or whether the interplay of the various factors of infectivity, recovery and mortality, may result in termination, whilst many susceptible individuals are still present in the unaffected population. It is difficult to treat this problem in its most general aspect. In the present communication discussion will be limited to the case in which all members of the community are initially equally susceptible to the disease, and it will be further assumed that complete immunity is conferred by a single infection.},

            With news pushed to smart phones in real time and social media reactions spreading across the globe in seconds, the public discussion can appear accelerated and temporally fragmented. In longitudinal datasets across various domains, covering multiple decades, we find increasing gradients and shortened periods in the trajectories of how cultural items receive collective attention. Is this the inevitable conclusion of the way information is disseminated and consumed? Our findings support this hypothesis. Using a simple mathematical model of topics competing for finite collective attention, we are able to explain the empirical data remarkably well. Our modeling suggests that the accelerating ups and downs of popular content are driven by increasing production and consumption of content, resulting in a more rapid exhaustion of limited attention resources. In the interplay with competition for novelty, this causes growing turnover rates and individual topics receiving shorter intervals of collective attention.},

Does the number of adherents increase or not, and how? No need to say that if quantitative answers and mathematical laws are found, agent-based models can be imagined to describe such non-equilibrium processes. It is found that empirical laws can be deduced and related to preferential attachment processes, like on an evolving network; we propose two diﬀerent algorithmic models reproducing as well the data.

It was found that: (1) AvramiWeibull function describes different types of the data better than Gompertz and Verhulst funtions, and (2), in comparison with Verhulst and Gompertz functions, AvramiWeibull function, expressed in the form: y(t)/ymax = 1exp[(t/)q] (where ymax is the maximum value of y(t) when t  , and  and q are constants), is equally very versatile in explaining the generation rate dy(t)/dt of items in terms of its parameters  and q. Using the basic concepts involved in the derivation of AvramiWeibull function for overall crystallization from melt and supersaturated solution, the growth behavior of cumulative number y(t) of items produced at time t by individual (simple) sources and collectives or groups of simple sources (i.e. complex or composite sources) is presented. Comparison of the process of receiving of citations by papers with the processes of occurrence of chemical reactions and crystallization of solid phases from melts and supersaturated solutions shows that this process is similar to that of overall crystallization of solid phases from melts and solutions. Analysis of growth of citations using AvramiWeibull function to individual papers published by different authors shows that 1 {\textless} q {\textless} 4 for most cases. This suggests that the process of citations to individual articles is mainly determined by progressive nucleation mode involving both diffusion and integration of published knowledge.},

As a first step towards empowerment of news consumers, the present study investigated how we are influenced by what we read about unfamiliar persons starring news headlines of trusted or distrusted outlets. We show that people’s social judgments rely to a large extent on the emotional content of information encountered, apparently unperturbed by its trustworthiness. We investigated the potential underlying cognitive-emotional mechanisms reflected in pupil dilation during social judgments and the confidence with which social judgments are made. Thirty participants viewed websites of trusted or distrusted news media sources exhibiting headlines about unfamiliar persons. Headlines with emotional rather than neutral contents led to faster and more extremely valenced social judgments, lower pupil dilation and higher confidence in those judgments. Only pupil dilation was sensitive to media source credibility, such that neutral headlines from distrusted sources led to the highest pupil dilation. Emotional contents thus enhance confidence in social judgments even if based on untrustworthy news. Meanwhile, cognitive resources to evaluate the credibility of news may primarily be allocated when emotional contents driving confident decisions are not available. Our findings indicate that decreasing confidence in emotional information appears key to consider credibility as a guard against fake news.},

In this preregistered study, we investigated the effects of social-emotional headline contents on social judgments and brain responses and whether they can be modulated by explicit evaluations of the trustworthiness of the media source. Participants (N=30) evaluated –and clearly discerned– the trustworthiness of news sources before they were exposed to person-related news headlines. Despite this intervention, social judgments and brain responses were dominated largely by emotional headline contents. Results suggest differential effects of source credibility might depend on headline valence. Electrophysiological indexes of fast emotional and arousal-related brain responses, as well as correlates of slow evaluative processing were enhanced for persons associated with positive headline contents from trusted sources, but not when positive headlines stemmed from distrusted sources. In contrast, negative headlines dominated fast and slow brain responses unaffected by explicit source credibility evaluations. These results provide novel insights into the brain mechanisms underlying the “success” of emotional news from untrustworthy sources, suggesting a pronounced susceptibility to negative information even from distrusted sources that is reduced for positive contents. The differential pattern of responses to misinformation in mind and brain sheds light on the cognitive mechanisms underlying the processing of misinformation and possible strategies to avoid their potentially detrimental effects.},

	abstract = {Microblogs are one of the main social networking channels by which information is spread. Millions of users repost information from microblogs and share embedded emotion at the same time. The present study employed a mimicked interface of microblog (sina Weibo) and recruited university students to investigate users’ propensity to repost microblogs of positive, negative or neutral valence, and studied the neural correlates with reposting microblogs of different emotional valence. Ninety pieces of microblog messages, consisting of 30 positive, 30 negative and 30 neutral were read by 28 participants (14 males and 14 females). Their propensity to repost, valence-related neural activity, and reposting-related neural activity were recorded when they read messages and decided whether to repost them. We found reposting behavior was moderated by emotion. Participants preferred to reposting emotional microblogs relative to neutral microblogs, corresponding to amplified activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, precuneus and tempoparietal junction (TPJ), the key nodes of cognitive control, emotion, self-relevance processing and mentalizing respectively. Moreover, negative microblogs were more reposted than positive ones, corresponding to amplified activity in postcentral gyrus, superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and TPJ. Reposting negative microblogs induced increased activity in bilateral TPJ, indicating that TPJ plays a key role on decisions to propagate negative information. These findings reveal an important behavioral pattern in which negative information prevails in the transmission through microblogs, as well as the neural correlates with this process. It also provides empirical evidence of how reposting works in microblogs and how the brain is involved in social propagation of information.},

	abstract = {The application of graph theory to brain networks has become increasingly popular in the neuroimaging community. These investigations and analyses have led to a greater understanding of the brain’s complex organization. More importantly, it has become a useful tool for studying the brain under various states and conditions. With the ever expanding popularity of network science in the neuroimaging community, there is increasing interest to validate the measurements and calculations derived from brain networks. Underpinning these studies is the desire to use brain networks in longitudinal studies or as clinical biomarkers to understand changes in the brain. A highly reproducible tool for brain imaging could potentially prove useful as a clinical tool. In this review, we examine recent studies in network reproducibility and their implications for analysis of brain networks.},
