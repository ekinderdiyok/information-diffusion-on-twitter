1. `information-diffusion-on-twitter.ipynb` is good for visualizing the results and running the code block by block. It imports `functions.py`
2. `functions.py` holds the custom functions and imports needed for python libraries. `functions.py` is imported by `information-diffusion-on-twitter.ipynb` at the beginning.
3. Please refer to to the methods section of `information-diffusion-on-twitter.pdf` to make the code run. You have to place `information-diffusion-on-twitter.ipynb` and `functions.py` in the same folder.
